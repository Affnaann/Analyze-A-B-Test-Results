# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists

### Part I - Probability

### Part II - A/B Test

### Part III - A regression approach
In this part we  will see that the result you achieved in the A/B test in Part II above can also be achieved by performing regression.
